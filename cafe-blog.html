                <h1>How Much Caffeine Is in Half-Caff Coffee?</h1>
                <br>
                  Regular caffeinated coffee can give you a pleasant caffeine buzz, 
                  but sipping decaf is a great way to enjoy the taste of coffee without the boost of caffeine. <br><br>
                  
                  But what about half-caff coffee? How much caffeine does it contain?<br><br>

                  The average cup (8 fl oz) of half-caff coffee contains about 47.5mg of caffeine, 
                  or about 11.87% of the recommended daily caffeine intake for adults. 
                  This beverage is a 50/50 combination of decaffeinated and caffeinated coffee. 
                  Drinking half-caff could help you lower your daily caffeine consumption.
                </p>

                <h2>Does half-caff coffee really have only half the caffeine of regular coffee?</h2>
                <br>
                It’s true! Half-caff coffee contains about half the caffeine of a regular serving of coffee. 
                That’s because it’s made using a 50/50 ratio of standard caffeinated and decaf coffee.<br><br>

                Of course, not all coffee contains an identical amount of caffeine. <br><br>

              <h1>Potential benefits of drinking half-caff coffee</h1>
              <br>
                Well, there are quite a few potential benefits to drinking half-caff coffee, including: <br><br>
                
                    <ul>
                      <li>Reduced caffeine intake</li>
                      <li>Gradual caffeine reintroduction</li>
                      <li>Caffeine health benefits</li>
                    </ul><br><br>
              
              <h2>Reducing your daily caffeine intake</h2>
              <br>
              Caffeine can help you feel more awake and alert but can also lead to some unpleasant side effects, 
              especially when consumed in large quantities. For this reason, many coffee lovers occasionally 
              switch from regular coffee to decaf. But this transition can be challenging, 
              as caffeine withdrawal can give you headaches, make you tired, 
              and even make it difficult to focus! Gradually transitioning from fully caffeinated coffee 
              to decaf is one of the best ways to decrease the severity of caffeine withdrawal symptoms.<br><br>
              
              Consequently, going from regular to half-caff can help you eventually transition to decaf-only.<br></br>

              So, if you’re not quite ready to change to decaf coffee, going half-caff could help you decrease 
              your caffeine intake while still providing a boost of caffeine to help you get through your day. <br></br>

              <h2>Gradually reintroducing caffeine</h2>
              <br>
              Half-caff coffee can also help you gradually reintroduce caffeine, preventing the common side 
              effects of caffeine overload (jitteriness, racing thoughts, rapid pulse). 
              You can even use this article’s handy half-caff caffeine comparison chart to start with 
              the lowest-possible half-caff options so you can gradually increase your caffeine consumption to a desired level.<br><br>

              <h2>Getting the health benefits of caffeine consumption</h2>
              <br>
              Too much caffeine can leave you feeling nervous and sick to your stomach. But in safe amounts, caffeine can be quite a beneficial stimulant.<br><br>

              Health benefits associated with caffeine consumption include: <br><br>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Decreased risk of developing type 2 diabetes</li>
                    <li>Lowered risk of developing colon cancer</li>
                    <li>Decreased risk of getting Alzheimer’s disease</li>
                  </ul><br><br>

              Because decaf coffee is almost caffeine-free, it can’t provide the same level of health benefits as regular, fully caffeinated coffee. 
              However, mixing these two coffees provides the health benefits of caffeine without the unwanted side effects of over-caffeination. <br><br>
